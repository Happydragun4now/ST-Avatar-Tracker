<h2>ST Avatar Tracker</h2>
<p>A basic extension for Silly Tavern that tries to keep the zoomed in avatar representing whoever is supposed to be speaking in the scene.
When user is supposed to respond, it forces the zoomed avatar to user's avatar. When a character is generating a response it forces the zoomed avatar to their avatar image. The idea is to be able to always see the zoomed avatars without micromanaging.

<h3>Possible Upcoming Features:</h3>
- Slight time delay to switch zoomed avatar (Seperate options for user and char).</br>
- Reverse mode, flips which avatar is shown at the time. </br>
